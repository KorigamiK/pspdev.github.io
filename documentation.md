# Additional Documentation
{: .fs-8 .fw-700 .text-center }

PSPDEV is made out of several components. Here is a (non-exhaustive) list of
links to the documentation available for them:

 - [PSPSDK](https://pspdev.github.io/pspsdk/): The documentation for the
   developer kit.
 - [PSP Allegrex documentation](https://pspdev.github.io/vfpu-docs/):
   Non-official documentation on the PSP CPU and VFPU.
 - [Unofficial PSP docs](https://uofw.github.io/upspd/docs/): A collection of docs
   from different authors and sources, covering more specific topics.
 - [Yet Another PSP Documentation](http://hitmen.c02.at/files/yapspd/): A very
   detailed hardware documentation, including software interfaces.
